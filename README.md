# Identifying-Patterns-in-Stock-Price-Movements-and-Predicting-Future-Price

Final project for Advanced Big Data Analytics course Spring 2016

Usage: run_pattern_finder.sh and select option for a pattern

This project describes the approach of programmatically identifying stock patterns of interest by scanning through a large pool of stocks. The objective is to find a particular pattern near its completion phase using modified Dynamic Time Warping algorithm and to run Random Forest regression in order to confirm the direction of the stock price movement. Three patterns – “V bottom”, “Cat’s ears”, and “Cup with handle” – are reviewed.
